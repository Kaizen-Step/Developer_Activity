st.write(""" Finally there are many more crypto developers than are accounted for in our report. Some teams are working on closed-source projects or deploy their code on-chain without ever open sourcing their contracts. We also undercount developers in roles such as backporting, testing, or release engineering as their efforts may not result in unique code contributions. Some teams first work in a closed source environment, then open-source their code later. It requires more than just software engineers to build 
crypto products that reach mainstream adoption, so this is a dramatic undercounting of the number of people building in crypto.
